<h2 id="what-is-r">What is R?</h2>
<p><a href="https://r-project.org">https://r-project.org</a></p>
<p>&ldquo;R is a free software environment for statistical computing and graphics.&rdquo;
R is open source, and its flexible and expandable nature has led to over 20,000 R packages being written to accomplish almost every task in data analytics imaginable, frequently in multiple ways.</p>
<p>The large user base has also generated tons of guides, online tutorials, and help to specific topics (and bugs).  The possibilities are endless, if sometimes chaotic.</p>
<h2 id="why-r">Why R?</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.win-vector.com/blog/2019/08/why-r">https://www.win-vector.com/blog/2019/08/why-r</a></p>
<p>&ldquo;In our opinion the R ecosystem is the fastest path to substantial data science, statistical, and machine learning accomplishment.&rdquo;
[Practical Data Science with R, by Zumel, Mount, and Manning]</p>
<p>Due to its open nature, R is constantly developing and expanding in capability.  Also, because it is freely available to anyone worldwide for any use, projects in R can be assured of an audience and the potential for use and collaboration is unrestricted.</p>
<h2 id="what-is-positrstudio">What is Posit(RStudio)?</h2>
<p><a href="https://posit.co">https://posit.co</a></p>
<p>Formerly known as Rstudio, Posit is the leading company in the R space, contributing to many packages and tools that have become de facto standards.  They also produce the Rstudio Desktop and Server development environments, as well as Shiny. <a href="https://posit.co/cloud">Posit.cloud</a> allows the use of RStudio in a remote environment, saving installation and configuration issues.  RStudio is expanding its capabilities as a Python editor as well.</p>
<h2 id="why-rstudio-desktop">Why RStudio Desktop?</h2>
<p>Rstudio Desktop, as a development environment, has in some ways tamed the chaos of the R landscape, although there are tradeoffs involved.  The RStudio development environment using RStudio Desktop (or server versions) is clear, powerful, easy-to-use, and a fast and effective way to get productive in R.  It is also standardized across all platforms (Linux, Server, Mac, Windows).</p>
<h2 id="what-is-the-tidyverse">What is the tidyverse?</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.tidyverse.org">https://www.tidyverse.org</a></p>
<p>&ldquo;The tidyverse is an <strong>opinionated</strong> collection of R packages designed for data science. All packages share an underlying design philosophy, grammar, and data structures.&rdquo;</p>
<h2 id="why-the-tidyverse">Why the tidyverse?</h2>
<p>Some of the tidyverse packages, such as ggplot2 and dplyr, are clear leaders in their domains for power and elegance, while others are on their way there.  Since tidyverse packages are very popular and are designed to work together, they form a good introduction to programming in R.</p>
<p>However, they are &ldquo;opinionated&rdquo; in the sense that their conventions may differ from many long-standing &ldquo;classic&rdquo; R packages.  Users should be aware that there is also a whole universe of non-tidyverse approaches to choose from.</p>
<h2 id="r-is-open-your-choice">R is open, your choice</h2>
<p>As open source software, there are many other ways to &ldquo;do R&rdquo;,  Base R in combination with other packages can accomplish the same tasks that the RStudio/tidyverse versions can.  There are also other development environments for R, or one can simply edit R code in a text editor.  Sophisticated editors such as Emacs can edit and interact with live R sessions at the same time.</p>
<h2 id="what-about-those-packages">What about those packages?</h2>
<p>You can discover packages from the full <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/available_packages_by_name.html">CRAN list</a> or read about curated collections of important packages on <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/web/views/">CRAN Task Views</a>.  There were 19,968 packages as of 2023-10-26.  <a href="https://cran.r-project.org">CRAN</a> is the Comprehensive R Archive Network.</p>
