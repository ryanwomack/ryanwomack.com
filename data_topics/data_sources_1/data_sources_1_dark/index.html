<section id="overview" class="level1" data-number="1">
<h1 data-number="1"><span class="header-section-number">1</span> Overview</h1>
<p>What do we think about when we look for data? Data is incredibly varied, and each researcher has their own needs. Finding a match between the researcher and a dataset is something of an art at times. Recognizing this, this workshop provides some general guidelines for thinking about and searching for data, and mentions major sources that most researchers will want to be familiar with. However, it is only a quick overview that scratches the surface of a complex topic. The goal is to provide a framework for searching for and locating data, as well as pointers to more detailed guides.</p>
<section id="scope" class="level2" data-number="1.1">
<h2 data-number="1.1" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="scope"><span class="header-section-number">1.1</span> Scope</h2>
<p>This workshop is centered on social science data sources, which can be put to multiple uses. We will make some nods to science data and humanities data, but the specialized needs of researchers in these fields are mostly beyond the scope of this brief introduction. Also this workshop discusses sources of data that are useful for research about the United States (although some sources also have international data). Federal government, New Jersey (but not other states), commercial/subscription, and nonprofit sources of data are covered. Note that Data Sources 2 (to be released in the future) will focus on international data.</p>

<section id="searching-for-data---the-process" class="level1" data-number="2">
<h1 data-number="2"><span class="header-section-number">2</span> Searching for data - the process</h1>
<p>Researchers often have a very specific need in mind, but it is always important to reflect on the “W”’s of data collection.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Who</strong> would collect such data?</li>
<li><strong>What</strong> data would be collected?</li>
<li><strong>Why</strong> would they collect it?</li>
<li><strong>When</strong> was it collected?</li>
<li><strong>Where</strong> was it collected?</li>
</ul>
<p>The answers to these questions can guide us to appropriate data sources.</p>
<section id="case-studies" class="level2" data-number="2.1">
<h2 data-number="2.1" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="case-studies"><span class="header-section-number">2.1</span> Case studies</h2>
<p>Let’s think about applying these questions to a few different research scenarios.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Business</strong> The researcher is interested in financial details and actions of a specific company. Who collects this data? Public companies are required (the “why”) to disclose financial details in annual and quarterly filings (the “when”) to the <a href="https://www.sec.gov/search-filings"><em>Securities and Exchange Commission</em></a>. This publicly available data becomes part of many data compiliations (the “where”). The “what” that is collected is the data in audited balance sheets and cash flow statements, and can be quite detailed. However, for other information, such as sales figures of particular products, costs associated with divisions of the company, and other details, the “why” is quite different. Releasing this information is not required, and so each company may or may not disclose such information (usually releasing only what makes them look good, such as when sales are growing.) Private companies also are not required to say much about their operations. Government sources will not help for this second category of information. But commercial business databases and business news sources do make efforts to investigate and compile this information to the extent possible.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Social behavior</strong> A researcher is interested in the linkage between teenage illegal drug use and health over time. Who collects this data? Because it deals both with minors, a sensitive population, a sensitive topic, and sensitive biological data, it is not the kind of data that people can be compelled to provide. Only surveys that are carefully designed to provide confidentiality, encourage participant participation, and guarantee that researchers will not misuse the data can approach such questions successfully. One example of this is the <a href="https://addhealth.cpc.unc.edu/"><em>The National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent to Adult Health (Add Health)</em></a>, whose use mostly falls into the category of <em>restricted data</em>, which will be discussed further below. The “who” for such data may be funders who are interested in the outcomes of such behavior (“why”). The “when”, “where”, and “what” may be limited by the circumstances of collection.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Health statistics</strong> A researcher is interested in cancer rates and obesity rates. Thinking about who or when this is collected may help understand the kind of data available. Hospitals track events that occur there. A cancer diagnosis or operation will be reported systematically. See <a href="https://wonder.cdc.gov/cancer.html"><em>CDC Wonder</em></a>. Other things that affect the general population, such as obesity, can only be inferred by sampling. See <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/obesity/data-and-statistics/index.html"><em>CDC Obesity</em></a> based on the survey, <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/brfss/"><em>Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System</em></a> where participants self-report their weight.</p></li>
</ul>

<section id="strategies" class="level2" data-number="2.2">
<h2 data-number="2.2" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="strategies"><span class="header-section-number">2.2</span> Strategies</h2>
<p>These questions may lead you to specific data sources or providers. If you are not finding the data you’re looking for, it is usually worthwhile to frame your search more generally. Internet searches are fine, but can be more relevant if you take into account the kinds of sources available.</p>
<p>Be aware that data sources change names and focus over time, or may be discontinued. So something that looks like a really great source might not be as current as you’d like. Also, as we’ll highlight below, some minoritized populations might not have received as much coverage in data sources as other groups. Extra effort may be required to uncover data in those cases.</p>
<p>Finally, it is important to recognize that for original research, data sources may not be obvious. When searching isn’t fruitful, looking at research articles that have investigated similar topics is often the best avenue to take. Other authors may have discovered a useful data source that you can also tap into. On the other hand, if other authors are collecting their own data to answer research questions like yours, that is a good sign that no general data source is out there for that kind of question.</p>

<p>As a reminder, this session focuses on US data.</p>
<section id="federal-government" class="level2" data-number="3.1">
<h2 data-number="3.1" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="federal-government"><span class="header-section-number">3.1</span> Federal Government</h2>
<p>The federal government is a massive provider of data, having the ability to comprehensively collect data across the country at scale, and to compel compliance in ways that others cannot. The federal government is also the custodian of administrative records such as those generated by the <a href="https://www.irs.gov/statistics"><em>Internal Revenue Service</em></a>, the <a href="https://www.ssa.gov/policy/"><em>Social Security Administration</em></a>, or <a href="https://www.ice.gov/statistics"><em>Immigration and Customs Enforcement</em></a>. Most government agencies will have a section on their website titled “statistics”, “data”, or “reports” where you can browse the kinds of general data they release to the public.</p>
<p>Although, at the time of this writing, many data sources (e.g., <a href="https://www.noaa.gov/"><em>National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration</em></a>, <a href="https://nces.ed.gov/"><em>National Center for Education Statistics</em></a> have seen removals and cuts under the current administration. The <a href="https://www.datarescueproject.org/"><em>Data Rescue Project</em></a> is tracking these events, coordinating archiving and preserving data, and providing links to <a href="https://www.datarescueproject.org/data-rescue-tracker/">backups</a>. <a href="https://archive.icpsr.umich.edu/datalumos/home"><em>DataLumos</em></a> from ICPSR is a major home for archived government data.</p>
<p>Some highlights of US government data</p>
<ul>
<li><p><a href="https://data.census.gov"><strong>Census</strong></a>. The Bureau of the Census is the largest collector of demographic information. The original Decennial Census has seen most of its questions moved to the American Community Survey, an annual sample that provides more up-to-date information, while the Decennial Census retains its role as a complete count of the population. The Census produces numerous <a href="https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys.html">other surveys</a> on business and other topics, as well as microdata.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="https://www.bls.gov/"><strong>Bureau of Labor Statistics</strong></a> - The BLS collects employment, inflation, and other information related to work, including the <a href="https://www.bls.gov/tus/"><em>American Time Use Study</em></a>.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="https://fred.stlouisfed.org/"><strong>FRED</strong></a> and <a href="https://alfred.stlouisfed.org/"><strong>ALFRED</strong></a> - The Federal Reserve Bank collects and archives major economic data series in their comprehensive FRED (Federal Reserve Economic Data) site, along with ALFRED (Archival FRED), which archives original releases of data. The original releases can later be updated and corrected (in FRED), but for economists and others studying how markets originally reacted to information, ALFRED is important.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="https://cde.ucr.cjis.gov/LATEST/webapp/#/pages/home"><strong>Crime Data Explorer</strong></a> - represents the current information from the Federal Bureau of Investigation’s <a href="https://www.fbi.gov/how-we-can-help-you/more-fbi-services-and-information/ucr"><em>Uniform Crime Statistics</em></a>.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="https://wonder.cdc.gov/"><strong>CDC Wonder</strong></a> - the Center for Disease Control’s data collection, a first stop for mortality, disease, and other health statistics.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="https://data.gov"><strong>Data.gov</strong></a> - Open data from across the federal government, a large and sometimes chaotic archive of full datasets.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>There are many, many more possibilities with federal data, but we’ll stop with these highlights.</p>

<p>There are many business databases that provide information about companies. For detailed financial information, <em>COMPUSTAT</em> (corporate financials) and <em>CRSP</em> (stock prices) are two of the most commonly used. At Rutgers these are available through the Rutgers Business School’s subscription to <a href="https://wrds-www.wharton.upenn.edu/"><em>WRDS</em></a>.</p>

<section id="restricted-data" class="level1" data-number="4">
<h1 data-number="4"><span class="header-section-number">4</span> Restricted data</h1>
<p>A word about restricted data. In the social sciences, there are privacy concerns around releasing data about sensitive topics, personally identifiable information, and data about vulnerable populations (minors, incarcerated, mentally ill, etc.). This can result in the free, publicly available datasets being somewhat limited. Accessing the more detailed data, with information at the individual level (microdata) often requires additional steps, where the researcher must apply to use the data and demonstrate that they can handle it responsibly. ICPSR is one major provider of <a href="https://www.icpsr.umich.edu/web/pages/ICPSR/access/restricted/">restricted data</a>.</p>
<p>Restricted data may have to be accessed in a secure data enclave. The <a href="https://www.census.gov/about/adrm/fsrdc.html"><em>Federal Statistical Research Data Centers</em></a> provide secure environments supporting qualified researchers using restricted-access data while protecting respondent confidentiality. These restricted-access data come from censuses and surveys of businesses and households, linked employer-employee data, and administrative records from federal and state agencies and other sources. The Census Bureau maintains and enhances these confidential microdata through the FSRDC network to equip researchers with the resources they need to generate insights for the public good.</p>
