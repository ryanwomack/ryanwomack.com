What is R? https://r-project.org
&ldquo;R is a free software environment for statistical computing and graphics.&rdquo; R is open source, and its flexible and expandable nature has led to over 20,000 R packages being written to accomplish almost every task in data analytics imaginable, frequently in multiple ways.
