## Data Publication 2

### Why Data Publication?

Sharing data is a way to maximize the impact and usefulness of your research, and is increasingly mandated by research funders.

Data should be shared in a manner that is FAIR, enabling the data to be:

- Findable, 
- Accessible,
- Interoperable, and
- Reusable

We should also CARE for our data:

The NIH is the most recent major US funding agency to promulgate data sharing guidelines and requirements, so their materials are as good a place as any to get more information...

[NIH on Sharing Scientific Data](https://sharing.nih.gov/data-management-and-sharing-policy/sharing-scientific-data/repositories-for-sharing-scientific-data)

NIH lists several
[Generalist Repositories](https://sharing.nih.gov/data-management-and-sharing-policy/sharing-scientific-data/generalist-repositories)
which are all good places to deposit data when more specialized repositories are not available.

- *[Dataverse]*(https://dataverse.org/)
- [Dryad](https://datadryad.org/)
- [Figshare](https://figshare.com/)
- [IEEE Dataport](https://ieee-dataport.org/)
- [Mendeley Data](https://data.mendeley.com/)
- *[OpenICPSR]*(https://openicpsr.org) - social science emphasis, free to use for Rutgers due to our institutional membership in ICPSR
- *[Open Science Framework]*(https://osf.io/)
- [Synapse](https://www.synapse.org/)
- [Vivli](https://vivli.org/)
- *[Zenodo]*(https://zenodo.org/)

A [comparison](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.3946719) of many of these repositories is available.

*bold* entries are recommended for their ease of use and suitability for a wide range of data.

Specialized repositories, if available, are the best place to deposit data with special characteristics.  These repositories are built to handle and showcase certain kinds of data.

To discover specialized repositories, such as the [Protein Data Bank](https://www.rcsb.org), use

[Re3data - the Registry of Research Data Repositories](https://www.re3data.org/)

### This workshop continues with a discussion of R package creation.
