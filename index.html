<p><strong>Librarianship</strong></p>
<p>Since 2013, I serve as <strong>Data Librarian</strong> for the New Brunswick
Libraries, part of <a href="https://www.libraries.rutgers.edu/">Rutgers University
Libraries</a>. Prior to this, I was
<em>Data and Economics Librarian</em>, and prior to that, <em>Business and Economics
Librarian</em>. Since 1999, I have been a member of the library faculty of
<a href="https://newbrunswick.rutgers.edu/">Rutgers University-New Brunswick</a>. I
was granted tenure and promoted to the rank of Librarian II in 2005. In
2019, I was promoted to the rank of <strong>Librarian I</strong> (equivalent to Full
Professor). I hold an M.A. in Economics from the University of
Pennsylvania, an M.S. in Library Science from the University of North
Carolina-Chapel Hill, and an M.S. in Statistics and Biostatistics from
Rutgers University-New Brunswick.</p>
<p>As Data Librarian for Rutgers-New Brunswick, I am responsible for <a href="https://libguides.rutgers.edu/data">Data Services</a>,
including outreach and training for data, assisting students and faculty, acquisition of data sources, development of research guides, and
providing support for quantitative research across a range of
disciplines. I led the development of the <a href="https://libguides.rutgers.edu/graduatespecialist">Graduate Specialist Program</a>, hiring Rutgers-NB graduate students to teach <a href="https://libcal.rutgers.edu/nblworkshops">workshops</a> and provide consultations in advanced research methods, including Python, R, and other <a href="https://libguides.rutgers.edu/datascience">data science</a> topics. I am serving from 2022 to 2025 as the <em>Head of the New Brunswick Libraries Research Services Unit</em>. I am particularly interested in developing and supporting data literacy and statistical literacy.</p>
<p>I am the subject specialist for and liaison to the <a href="https://economics.rutgers.edu/">Department of
Economics</a>, and the <a href="https://dafre.rutgers.edu/">Department of
Agricultural, Food, and Resource Economics</a>.
I manage the Libraries&rsquo; collections, give instructional sessions, and
help researchers and students locate information in these disciplines. I am also the New Brunswick Libraries Point of Contact for Government Documents and Statistical Data Services.</p>
<p>Some occasional thoughts about data and other things are at my <a href="https://ryanwomack.com/blog">blog here</a>. I also maintain the Libraries research guide for
<a href="https://libguides.rutgers.edu/data">Data</a> and for <a href="https://libguides.rutgers.edu/economics">Economics</a>.</p>
<p>A current focus for me is the development of useful guides to data and statistical resources related to Mongolia and the countries of Central Asia (Kazakhstan, Kyrgzstan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan).
The <a href="https://camgdp.org">Central Asia and Mongolia Gender Data Portal (CAMGDP)</a> exemplifies this.</p>

    <p>I just posted a rather uncharacteristic video on YouTube about my deletion of videos. Usually I confine myself to either instructional videos or presentations, but this was just a rambling self-explanatory monologue.
This is a text version of some similar thoughts.
In my work, my personal organizing practice is to scan for files that are ten years old (or more) and reviewing them to either delete or permanently archive as a memento of the past.<span> <a href="https://ryanwomack.com/blog/2023/06/missing-time-series/">Read more...</a></span>

    <p>About three years back, I had posted some tips for job applicants on my old blog, which I am reposting here for convenience.
After having been on search committees yet again, I am compelled to write up some additional thoughts. The tips in the earlier post are still valid. This time, I may be a bit more pointed and direct about just a few items.
interview etiquette - thank you notes I know that no one really gets consistent instructions about interview etiquette anymore.<span> <a href="https://ryanwomack.com/blog/2022/06/on-job-applications-and-interviews/">Read more...</a></span>

    <p>I am still torn up by the Sackler verdict, which absolves the Sackler family of guilt for deceptively promoting addictive and ultimately deadly drugs in order to boost their all-American profits. The result was over 500,000 all-American corpses due to overdose, and the judicial system&rsquo;s recent verdict has only awarded approximately enough money to cover the funeral expenses of these corpses. The Sacklers get to pay these expenses over a decade while keeping their fortunes intact and being shielded from further prosecution.<span> <a href="https://ryanwomack.com/blog/2021/09/about-the-sackler-verdict/">Read more...</a></span>
