                <h2 id="calyxos">CalyxOS</h2>
<p>Well, it is not really anyone&rsquo;s fault but Google&rsquo;s. Yet we expect Google to be evil, so their <a href="https://cyberinsider.com/privacy-focused-grapheneos-warns-google-is-locking-down-android/">removal of</a> side-loading (a.k.a., being able to install the apps you want) and access to preview releases is not so surprising.  However, this has caused <a href="https://calyxos.org/news/2025/08/01/a-letter-to-our-community/">CalyxOS</a> to do something akin to suspending their operations. While they claim that they are doing this for security reasons and will return, it still means that they are out of action for several months. And the sudden departure of two of their leads is certainly alarming. It is disappointing, but it looks like a move to <a href="https://grapheneos.org">GrapheneOS</a> or something else is in the cards for me. Regardless of if the Calyx Institute revives itself in the future, this is enough of a break in continuity to ensure that I cannot rely on CalyxOS.</p>
<h2 id="linux-mint">Linux Mint</h2>
<p>This puts me in mind of LinuxMint many years back, when it was revealed that LinuxMint had been hacked and installs were serving up a <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/hacker-hundreds-were-tricked-into-installing-linux-mint-backdoor/">backdoored version</a>. Although I don&rsquo;t recall all the details, I recall at the time discussion of how the install and signature checking was weak, exposing novice users to the hacked exploit. There were <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/linuxmint/comments/p3pelc/linux_mint_isnt_safe_or_secure_is_such_statement/">other</a> <a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/176495/ubuntu-developers-say-linux-mint-is-insecure-are-they-right/">issues</a> as well.</p>
<p>Those vulnerabilities pointed to a certain carelessness or lack of oversight that bothered me. Although LinuxMint fixed them, it was enough for me to turn away from them, since there are many other options available.</p>
<h2 id="academiaedu">Academia.edu</h2>
<p>Finally, a sudden announcement from <a href="https://www.academia.edu/privacy.asp">Academia.edu</a> has caused me to delete my account there. <a href="https://www.bookandsword.com/2025/09/18/i-am-no-longer-on-academia-edu/">This post</a> explains it much better than I have time for here, but it is still shocking that Academia has taken such an extreme turn in this direction, to be able to create fraudulent content on the back of users. I never really used the site, but in the environment of ten years ago, I felt the need to have my own profile just to be in control. That illusion of control has now been turned into its own point of vulnerability and exploitation.</p>
<h2 id="the-future-of-privacy">The Future of Privacy</h2>
<p>Drawing a moral out these unrelated cases, I would say that slow, steady, careful, and well-supported development is what the end user needs to look for in the services they use. Open source and mission focus are always a plus, but not necessarily enough. But the external environment can be hostile to any individual service.</p>
<p>I hope to have some more detailed posts on positive aspects of data privacy in the future. But these developments show that maintaining control over your own information, and even your identity, is a constant, somewhat tiring battle in today&rsquo;s world. Wishing everyone luck with this!</p>
