                <div class="blog-post-content">
                <p>I am responding to a now defunct post by my colleague, Francesca Giannetti.  The discussion there is about the PLE, or personal learning environment.  I think it’s interesting to reflect on, because most of the time I am just marinating in my PLE rather than conscious of it.</p>
<p>I find that I use different communication mechanisms for different purposes, and they have different time scales and impacts on my thinking.  Enough generalities, let’s jump in!</p>
<ul>
<li>Listservs and mailing lists – mostly keeping up on “official” business, whether from work or my membership organizations (<a href="http://iassistdata.org/">IASSIST</a>, <a href="http://amstat.org/">American Statistical Association</a>).  I experience this as a continuous flow of incremental information.</li>
<li>RSS – I am committed to this antique technology because I find it is there just when I want it.  A feed reader is a like a faithful servant that doesn’t bother you when you are busy with other things, but keeps everything ready for you when you return.  I monitor my journal TOCs, academic blogs, job postings, and some general news via RSS.  Since Google Reader went belly up, I have been using <a href="http://lzone.de/liferea/">Liferea</a> for Linux with satisfaction.</li>
<li>Blogs  – Interesting to skim, but there are only a few of regular value for me, such as <a href="http://r-bloggers.com/">R-bloggers</a> to keep me up to date on new R developments.</li>
<li>Email – this is problematic because I am like many who struggle with e-mail.  My e-mail queue becomes my de facto to-do list too often, and I often fail to prioritize the right things.  Too many different kinds of activities end up in e-mail.  I definitely do not like to read long e-mails.</li>
<li>PDFs – for long-term thoughtful academic reading, I prefer to accumulate folders full of interesting PDF articles and books, and then devour them on quiet days.</li>
<li>Books – My print books tend to be heavy tomes on math, statistics, or literature.  After seeing these in piles for a couple of years making me feel guilty, I feel the necessary pressure to plow through them.  Books express some of my grander (and more unrealistic?) ambitions.</li>
<li>Websites and bookmarks – I track these, try to organize my bookmarks, keep them in Libguides, and more, but I find that I don’t return to websites nearly as often as I think I will.  This is primarily because my list of substantive readings in the other formats above are plenty enough to fill all of my time.  So, unless a website is in my face, or a really good aggregator, like R-bloggers, it tends not to get my attention.</li>
<li>Videos – I have appreciated some video tutorials (in addition to producing a few of my own), especially in structured courses on Coursera and other sites.  But Youtube is an oceanic resource, but no matter what I go to it for, I always end up in K-pop, so it is dangerous from a productivity perspective [has anyone developed a “serious-only” filter for YouTube?].  I dislike sitting through an hour-long video talk with no associated text or slides to guide some skimming ahead.  If necessary, I will download the video and play it at double speed in VLC.</li>
<li>Conference Talks and Presentations – These tend to be more useful for me as a continual update to the current landscape in librarianship, helping to set directions for more focused reading and exploration. Again, I prefer skimmable formats to be made available, even for things I might be attending in person.</li>
