The image above is a wordcloud based on the word frequency in the personal statement that I used for promotion&mdash;my career in feline form.</p>
<p>I was inspired by my colleague
<a href="https://francescagiannetti.com/personal-statement/">Francesca Giannetti&rsquo;s post</a> about the personal statement she used for her <strong>!successful!</strong> tenure applicaton at Rutgers.  In her post, she discusses the benefit to be gained from sharing one&rsquo;s own articulation of how one has built a professional identity in a new area of services.  In her case, that is digital humanities.  In mine, that would be data librarianship, which I entered upon in 2008 in a career turn from business librarianship.  Covering my data work from 2008 to 2018, it can provide some insight into the decisions and adaptations I made during the period of data librarianship&rsquo;s emergence.  It is also perhaps the best single encapsulation of what my career has been about, at least up to that time.</p>
<p>While it is certainly not perfect, and <em>many would argue that it is too long</em>, I humbly offer up my own personal statement from 2018, which led to, <em>or at least did not put the kibosh on</em>, my promotion to Librarian I (Full Professor equivalent) at Rutgers in 2019.</p>
