                <div class="blog-post-content">
                <p>So, a couple of years ago, I wrote here to introduce the possibility of my blogging at this site.  At that time, I said that I would be continuing to also post work-related announcements at <a href="https://ryandata.wordpress.com">ryandata.wordpress.com</a>.</p>
<p>Well, time has passed, and I am trying to simplify many things in my life. The need for a blog site announcing things has been superseded by the growing capabilities of our <a href="https://libcal.rutgers.edu/nblworkshops">workshop calendar</a> and the increasing accumulation of material on the <a href="https://libguides.rutgers.edu/graduatespecialist">graduate specialist libguide</a>, in addition to supplemental resources like the <a href="https://github.com/NBLGraduateSpecialistProgram/">graduate specialist github</a>.  That is before I even mention my own <a href="https://github.com/ryandata">ryandata github</a> or <a href="https://youtube.com/librarianwomack">librarianwomack Youtube channel</a>.</p>
<p>In short, a separate wordpress site has become superfluous.  The ryandata site will be allowed to <em>gradually decay</em> away over time (as I delete posts older than 10 years).</p>
<p>This site will become my <em>exclusive</em> blog outlet for professional musings about data, statistics, librarianship, tech thoughts, and other miscellanea.</p>
<p>I am trying to support workflows and processes that are open, minimalist, noncommercial, and functional.  Noncommercial does not necessarily mean free, since paying for basic things like hosting and email fits better into my interpretation of noncommercial than &ldquo;free&rdquo; services built around advertising and marketing. I am not knocking Wordpress, which has been very good to me over the years (2009-2021), but I prefer a more DIY approach where I am in control.</p>
<p>One of these days I will post more about my Hugo experiences :)</p>
